Key Objectives:
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a vehicle dataset.
Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure accuracy and usability.
Visualize key trends such as price distribution, top manufacturers, and correlations.
Build and evaluate a predictive model to estimate car prices.
Key Features:
Data Cleaning:

Removed rows with missing values in critical columns (price, year, odometer).
Handled missing values in non-critical columns (model) by filling with "Unknown".
Filtered unrealistic prices (e.g., below $500 or above $200,000).
Standardized text fields for consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution of car prices.
Top car manufacturers based on the number of listings.
Scatter plot for analyzing mileage vs. price.
Average car price by state and fuel type.
Correlation heatmap between numerical variables.
Predictive Modeling:

Built a simple linear regression model using year and odometer as features.
Evaluated the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
